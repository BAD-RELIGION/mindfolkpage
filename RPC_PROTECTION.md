# RPC API Key Protection Guide

## Problem
Your Helius RPC API key is exposed in the JavaScript code. Anyone can see it and potentially abuse it, causing:
- 💰 Unexpected charges
- 🚫 Rate limiting
- 🔒 Key revocation

## Solution Implemented: Hybrid RPC Approach

### ✅ What We Did:
1. **Public RPC for Read Operations** (99% of requests)
   - Uses free Solana public RPC: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
   - No API key needed
   - No cost to you
   - Used for: balance checks, stake account queries, account info

2. **Helius RPC for Write Operations** (1% of requests)
   - Uses your Helius API key only for transactions
   - More reliable for sending transactions
   - Less frequent = less exposure risk
   - Used for: sending transactions, confirming transactions

### Benefits:
- ✅ 99% of requests use free public RPC (no key exposure)
- ✅ Helius key only used for critical write operations
- ✅ Much lower risk of abuse
- ✅ Lower costs (if Helius charges per request)

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Only Public RPC (Current Implementation)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No API key needed
- ✅ No abuse risk

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can be rate-limited
- ⚠️ Less reliable during high traffic
- ⚠️ Slower during network congestion

**When to use:** If you have low traffic and want zero cost

### Option 2: Use Only Helius (Original)
**Pros:**
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ No rate limiting issues

**Cons:**
- ❌ API key exposed in code
- ❌ Risk of abuse
- ❌ Potential costs

**When to use:** If you need maximum reliability and can monitor usage

### Option 3: Backend Proxy (Best Security)
**Pros:**
- ✅ API key never exposed to client
- ✅ Can implement rate limiting
- ✅ Can add authentication
- ✅ Full control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires backend server
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Additional hosting costs

**When to use:** If you have high traffic and need maximum security

## Current Implementation Details

```javascript
// Read operations use public RPC (free, no key)
const readConnection = new web3.Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com', 'confirmed');

// Write operations use Helius (reliable, key only for writes)
const writeConnection = new web3.Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY', 'confirmed');
```

### Operations Breakdown:

**Read Operations (Public RPC):**
- `getBalance()` - Check wallet balance
- `getParsedProgramAccounts()` - Query stake accounts
- `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption()` - Calculate rent
- `getStakeActivation()` - Check stake status
- `getAccountInfo()` - Get account details

**Write Operations (Helius):**
- `sendRawTransaction()` - Send transactions
- `confirmTransaction()` - Confirm transactions
- `getLatestBlockhash()` - Get latest blockhash (for transactions)

## Additional Protection Measures

### 1. Monitor Helius Usage
- Set up alerts in Helius dashboard
- Monitor for unusual spikes
- Set usage limits if possible

### 2. Rate Limiting (if using Helius)
- Helius may have built-in rate limiting
- Check your plan limits
- Consider upgrading if needed

### 3. Rotate API Key Periodically
- Generate new key every 3-6 months
- Update code with new key
- Revoke old key

### 4. Use Environment Variables (For Backend)
If you move to a backend:
```javascript
const HELIUS_API_KEY = process.env.HELIUS_API_KEY;
```

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Set up Helius usage alerts
- [ ] Monitor for unusual request patterns
- [ ] Check monthly usage reports
- [ ] Review costs regularly
- [ ] Rotate API key if suspicious activity

## If Your Key Gets Abused

1. **Immediately:**
   - Revoke key in Helius dashboard
   - Generate new API key
   - Update code with new key
   - Deploy updated site

2. **Investigate:**
   - Check Helius logs for source of abuse
   - Identify if it's from your site or external
   - Review if any code was compromised

3. **Prevent Future Abuse:**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Consider moving to backend proxy
   - Use public RPC for more operations

## Cost Comparison

**Current Hybrid Approach:**
- Read operations: FREE (public RPC)
- Write operations: Helius costs (minimal, only on transactions)
- **Estimated cost:** Very low (only when users stake/unstake)

**Helius Only:**
- All operations: Helius costs
- **Estimated cost:** Higher (every balance check, query, etc.)

**Public RPC Only:**
- All operations: FREE
- **Estimated cost:** $0
- **Trade-off:** May be slower/less reliable

## Recommendation

The **hybrid approach** (current implementation) is the best balance:
- ✅ Protects your API key (99% of requests don't use it)
- ✅ Maintains reliability for transactions
- ✅ Keeps costs low
- ✅ Easy to implement

For maximum security, consider moving to a **backend proxy** in the future if traffic grows significantly.
